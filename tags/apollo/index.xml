Through this course, you will be able to identify key parts of self-driving cars and get to know Apollo architecture. You will be able to utilize Apollo HD Map, localization, perception, prediction, planning and control, and start the learning path of building a self-driving car.
My notes for this course:

Content: How the vehicle localizes itself with a single-digit-centimeter-level accuracy.
Localization methods in Apollo The RTK (Real Time Kinematic) based method which incorporates GPS and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) information. The multi-sensor fusion method which incorporates GPS, IMU, and LiDAR information. Inertial navigation Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) refers to a constellation of satellites providing signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data to GNSS receivers.</description></item><item><title>[MOOC] Apollo Lesson 2: HD Maps</title><link>https://aicurious.io/posts/apollo-sdc-lesson-2-hd-maps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicurious.io/posts/apollo-sdc-lesson-2-hd-maps/</guid><description>This is my note for lesson 2 of MOOC course: Self-Driving Fundamentals - Featuring Apollo. Content: High Definition maps for self driving cars.
HD Maps have a high precision and contain a lot of information than your ordinary map on smartphone, such as lane line markings, 3D representation of the road network, traffic signs... You can what you see and GPS to locate your self in the world and identify other objects.</description></item><item><title>[MOOC] Apollo Lesson 1: SDC Fundamentals</title><link>https://aicurious.io/posts/apollo-sdc-lesson-1-fundamentals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicurious.io/posts/apollo-sdc-lesson-1-fundamentals/</guid><description>This is my note for lesson 1 of MOOC course: Self-Driving Fundamentals - Featuring Apollo.
