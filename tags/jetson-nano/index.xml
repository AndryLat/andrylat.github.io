In this project, I have successfully deployed 3 deep neural networks and some computer vision algorithms on a super cheap hardware of Jetson Nano. In the last two posts, I have introduced the system in hardware and software design. In this week, I write about two machine learning modules: Object Detection Module and Lane Detection Module.</description></item><item><title>Advanced driver-assistance system on Jetson Nano Part 2 - Software design</title><link>https://aicurious.io/posts/adas-jetson-nano-software/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aicurious.io/posts/adas-jetson-nano-software/</guid><description>Recently, I have built a prototype of an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) using a Jetson Nano computer.

In this project, I have successfully deployed 3 deep neural networks and some computer vision algorithms on a super cheap hardware of Jetson Nano. I decided to write this post series to share about how this system was designed and implemented. In this series, I will introduce the overall design of the system, 3 deep neural networks I used for environment analysis and some tutorials on TensorRT - the core technology to optimize neural networks for NVIDIA's system.</description></item></channel></rss>
